# Renewable-Energy-Monitoring-System-For-Microgrids
Renewable energy microgrids are vital for rural areas with rising power demand. This project presents an IoT-based renewable energy monitoring system for real-time tracking of generation, storage, and consumption. Solar panels and a dynamo generate power stored in batteries. A microcontroller monitors voltage, current, power, and battery status.
